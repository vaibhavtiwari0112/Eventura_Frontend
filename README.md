# Eventura - Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes
- This is a frontend scaffold for the Eventura project. Replace the mock data and demo flows with real API calls to your microservices (User Service, Catalog, Show, Booking).
- Uses Redux Toolkit for simple state slices (auth, movies, booking).
- Seat locking and payment flows are mocked â€” integrate Booking Service and Payment Service for production.
